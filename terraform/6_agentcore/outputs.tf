    âœ… Agent infrastructure deployed successfully!
    
    AgentCore Agents:
    # - Planner (Orchestrator)
    # - Tagger:
    # - Reporter
    # - Charter
    # - Retirement
    
    SQS Queue: ${aws_sqs_queue.analysis_jobs.name}
    
    To test the system:
    1. The agents are deployed using OpenAI Agents SDK with AWS Bedrock AgentCore
    2. Run the full integration test:
       cd backend
       uv run test_full.py
    
    3. Monitor agent performance in AWS Console:
       - Bedrock AgentCore console for agent status
       - CloudWatch Logs for agent execution logs
       - SSM Parameter Store for agent ARNs
    
    Note: Agents are deployed as AgentCore endpoints, not Lambda functions.
    They can be invoked directly or through the SQS orchestration system.
